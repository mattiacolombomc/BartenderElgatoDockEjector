# BartenderElgatoDockEjector

This AppleScript automates the process of triggering the ejection of the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock using its Utility app through Bartender 4. It can save you time and clicks by letting you eject your Elgato dock with a simple script execution.

## Prerequisites

Before you use this script, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Bartender 4: This is the app that manages the macOS menu bar and will be used to trigger the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock Utility. You can download Bartender 4 from [here](https://www.macbartender.com/Bartender4/).

- Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Pro Dock Utility: This app provides controls for the Elgato Thunderbolt Dock, including the ability to eject it. Download and install the Utility from [here](https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027964612-How-do-I-install-the-Thunderbolt-3-Pro-Dock-Utility).

## Usage

Simply run the script whenever you want to eject your Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock. The script simulates the keyboard shortcut to open Bartender's search bar, types in "elg" to locate the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock Utility, and simulates the necessary key presses to trigger the dock ejection.

## Customization

By default, the script uses the "CMD + OPTION + 0" keyboard shortcut to open Bartender's search bar. If you have a different shortcut set up in Bartender, you'll need to modify the script accordingly. You can find a complete list of AppleScript key codes [here](https://eastmanreference.com/complete-list-of-applescript-key-codes), which will help you customize the script to match your preferred Bartender shortcut.
